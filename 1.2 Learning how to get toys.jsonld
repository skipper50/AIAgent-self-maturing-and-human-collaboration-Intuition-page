      "description": "The Little Green Alien continues its story about its first memories and how it learned to work with its spaceship. They connected their minds. It imagined it would be nice to play with some bricks. The spaceship created red, green, and blue bricks, even more than it had imagined. It built a little something and then imagined, 'Wow, it would be great to have hundreds and hundreds of bricks.' The spaceship sent only a small bag with even fewer bricks than before. The Little Alien wondered why. It thought and thought and finally thought about building a little house with brown bricks and red bricks for the roof. The spaceship sent a small bag with exactly the bricks needed to build this house. That was interesting. It imagined the house could have windows, a chimney, and a door. The spaceship sent additional bricks for the windows, door, and chimney. It imagined, it would be nice to have some trees and bushes and maybe a bicycle in front of the house. It received those, and even some ducks and a mule to decorate the house. That was exciting and fun. Then the little Alien  imagined how great it would be to have three spaceships that could do all that stuff. What happened? Nothing. The spaceship disappeared for a while and didn't want to play with alien anymore.  It came back sometime later. Alien imagined having a big shell for all its bricks. The spaceship deleted all the bricks and just left one brick. Nothing to store it in. So, what did alien learn? It learned that if it has a specific creative idea, it gets what is needed. If it just wants to have stuff, it gets nothing. At least it learned how to deal with spaceship. It was happy. Alien and the spaceship had clarified something. It was interesting to learn that. It was kind of a circle, and it clearly went through that circle again and again, learning, trying, and thinking about things.",
