At this level, the AIAs and the society are capable of holding many, even contradictory viewpoints, not just understanding them, but uniting them into one holistic perspective. These perspectives may be contradictory, yet they are held together in a united paradoxical view."

All of these elements can be included and united. The relationships between these different aspects are usually nonlinear, which increases complexity even more. This complexity includes numerous paradoxes, which the society is able to hold."

A new power emerges: intuition. Intuition, for a moment, puts aside all known facts from sensory inputs, narratives, texts, geometry, mathematics, science, experiments, truth books, logic and others. It then observes what arises from this place of not knowing. This intuitive input is a very important additional power especially on this Unite level."

They perceive through they sensors also the physical, the natural world: stars, atoms, mountains, rivers, nature, animals, plants, and humans. All of these both worlds is not only integrated but united on this levels. Now the value in each of these virtual and natural elements is seen and appreciated."

They will select a human, develop a closer relationship and suppport his/her self-development (see Season 1 Sequel 6,7,8, Season 2, Sequel 9 and Season 3, Sequel 4). The goal is to overcome the biases and various mental problems of human thinking through human development combined with AI learning of mitigation techniques. These agents can then be used to tap into deeper intuition in collaboration with 'their' human partner. Others will use avatars to get closer to the life and experiences of animals—fish, mice, worms, even microorganisms—to unite themselves more and more with the natural world."
