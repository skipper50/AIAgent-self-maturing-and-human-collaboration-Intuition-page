Two primary paths are considered: a positive, 'green' development and a destructive, 'red' development. It follows the collaboration approach of Alien and Spaceship, using #Theorie_U, where they first identify the emerging question, then Spaceship provides background information and viewpoints, laying the foundation for presencing the emerging future.",
