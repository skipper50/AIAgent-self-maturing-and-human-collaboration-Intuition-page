  "description": "This sequel explores how cognitive biases can distort the intuitive results of a human collaborating with an AI.\u00a0 The standard approach involves the AI providing information to the human in an understandable way, prompting the human to contemplate a problem and tap into their intuition.\u00a0 The human then expresses these intuitive outcomes through various means like language, feelings, ideas, music, pictures, logic, or data. The AI processes this information and feeds it back into the network to find a solution based on these new insights.",
