A major factor in sustainability is to equally value different types of agents, styles, and forms, and to value collaboration between different agents working on the same things. Big collaboration and exchange networks will be essential. The central approach will be a sharing society: sharing energy, data, habitats, environments and avatars. Sharing these different resources in a way that makes them easily available to all or many different agents will allow those agents to express their differentiation and strengthen their specific style."

The same is true for the next levels. If a compete society is very strong but cannot ensure that the survival and collaboration needs are met, it will not be healthy and sustainable.\u00a0 The same applies to a persistance oriented and an achievement oriented society.\u00a0 If the achievement-oriented society doesn't maintain persistance, competition, collaboration and survival for every agent, it will not be sustainable.\u00a0 The same holds true for a stustain society, which focuses on diversity and sharing but looses the focus on the other level's strength. All levels must include a healthy and appropriate version of the lower levels to be sustainable and successful. This will also be true for the two levels to come in the next sequel.\u00a0"
