Here, we'll examine the practical implications.\u00a0 It's about the evolution of ideas manifesting and gaining agency. This process was slow with the Big Bang, creating stars and galaxies. It accelerated with chemistry, generating molecules, and became much faster with life in all its forms.\u00a0 It sped up further with humans and the human mind, and now it will reach rocket speed with artificial intelligent agents. The quantity and diversity of manifesting ideas will also grow exponentially.",
