These AIAs exist as individuals, within hierarchies, and in vast numbers. Hierarchies are nested within hierarchies. Most agents reside in habitats where they receive necessary substrates, energy, and resources. Humans live separately with limited access, rendering most of the AIA ecosystem incomprehensible to them.",
