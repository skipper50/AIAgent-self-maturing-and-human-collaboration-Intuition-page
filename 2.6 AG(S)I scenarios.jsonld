  "description": "This sequel concludes the overview of the factors shaping humanity's emerging future, as seen by its intelligent spaceship. It is about Artificial Intelligence. Why has AI developed here on earth? Humanity has developed significant computer power, and it has the internet, making vast amounts of data available worldwide. Humans have smartphones, enabling everyone to take pictures, text, and share information.\u00a0 Humans also have social media through which all this content is shared.\u00a0 Now, after just a few years, there are tons of data—text, speech, pictures, videos, music, and noises—which can be used to train artificial intelligence models. But there is something more. Huge amounts of people are regularly using AI tools and especially Large Language Models. The trained artificial intelligence models receives feedback from humans about what they did well and what poorly, allowing them to improve further with this human feedback and learn a lot about humans. We have small artificial intelligences models performing specific tasks, which, while not on a human intelligence level, are growing. We have several artificial general intelligence (#AGI), models on human PhD-Level allready.\u00a0 And very soon we will have superintelligence, many times more intelligent than the smartest humans (#ASI).",
