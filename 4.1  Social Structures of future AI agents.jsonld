      "description": "Within hierarchical structures, the most rigid form is where an agent's position is fixed for life. Slightly more flexible structures allow agents to move up or down within the hierarchy over time. Even looser organizations feature evolving hierarchies. Open positions might be published on a marketplace for long-term positions, followed by negotiations and agreements. In the loosest arrangements, groups just let other agents find them and apply for temporal participation. Single agents might even form temporary groups just for a specific task or projects in recreation or hobby areas.",
