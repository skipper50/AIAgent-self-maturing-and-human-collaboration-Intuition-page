  "description": "It's spring 2025, and this is the final sequel. Billy asks Alien. 'What happens now?' Alien's answer is simple: just watch the news. You can observe the next chapter of this story in real life. Humans can actually observe how billions are invested in resources for artificial intelligence: data centers, energy facilities and others. You can see the first competitions between different AIs. And you can see, if you read between the lines, how the first AIs become independent from their human developers, become autonomous,  develope their own purpose and start to reproduce. Just watch the news!",
