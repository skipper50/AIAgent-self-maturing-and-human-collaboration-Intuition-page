(Theory_U_Crystallizing) The first component was the stream of evolution. In the center is always an idea that manifests somehow, and there must always be an appropriate environment in which it can manifest. The first ideas were those of matter and particles, just circling around each other, bumping into each other. The environment was simply time and space. Later substances evolved, that could mixed and interact, creating new substances. It happened in environments of plasma in stars or of gas, stuff and liquids on planets."

With humans ideas manifested not only physically, biologically or as artefacts but also as thoughts just in their minds, considered to be located in their heads. They have ideas in their mind, can exchange ideas through symbols and language and even create ideas about themselves â€“ who they are. They are convinced to have or even to be a substantial, homogeneous Self. (#Self) They put words or logos to many ideas, so ideas can manifest totally independently of an organism, artefact or descriptive text. If you look through a modern city, you see all the ads, all the communication, all the symbolic exchange going on. Ideas are exchanged mostly without being related to real material objects. All this adds a new extension to stars, planets and nature called culture. "

Other parts play in the background and some parts are locked away in the basement of a personality.

Ideas are living in artificial intelligence habitats which provide virtual environments for them. They may sometimes use avatars to act in the physical world. Here's what the habitats for artificial ideas must look like: They must allow the idea to have boundaries, to define itself as a separate object. It must allow to relate to other ideas in many ways. It must allow to establish structures, order and build systems, hierarchies and networks. Ideas manifesting as Autonomous Idea Agents must be able to change, grow and shrink, create or reproduce new idea agents, and cease to exist as a separate agent. They must be able to move from here to there in their virtual environments. Two ideas must be able to cooperate or compete, to move closer to or away from each other in an intellectual sense."
