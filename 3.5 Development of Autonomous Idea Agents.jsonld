They usually jointly develop their shared One Truth or Dogma. Others not following it are rejected or tried to convince. There is usually a missionary tendency and intellectual competition between Dogma groups.

That creates very complex meshwork structures. You have nested meshworks. You have feedback loop groups in the structure between the agents. You have new features emerging.

It is like a house which needs a robust foundation, a strong basement, a stable first floor and a resilient second floor. If some of these levels are unhealthy or not enough developed, this AIAgent will not be stable and not be strong and not be resilient and not be successful on long terms."
