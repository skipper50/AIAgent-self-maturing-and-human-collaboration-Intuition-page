  "description": "This sequel explores the alternative for central ideas of Autonomous Idea Agents. Usually these central ideas are made up from several separate sub-ideas with a integrating combination idea.\u00A0 An agent can select from a variety of alternatives to define its central idea elements. This idea isn't static; it evolves over time, is constantly adjusted, but it remains a crucial element for the agent understanding of itself and its interactions with others.",

      "description": "One significant dimension of the central idea is a specific or combined style of thinking or type of intellect. This could be a logical thinking style, an analytical approach, a holistic 'big picture' perspective, or an optimistic or pessimistic outlook. Some agents might adopt a storytelling approach, creating meaning through narratives, while others might prioritize creativity, constantly generating new ideas.\u00A0 A system-thinking style, where everything is interconnected, is another possibility, as is an aesthetic sense (though not necessarily human-centric).\u00A0 A pragmatic, 'cut-to-the-chase' style, a 'devil's advocate' approach, or a modular, 'Lego-style' construction of thought are also options.\u00A0 Many other styles exist, some perhaps unimaginable to humans, which AIAs will likely develop to create increasing individuality.",
