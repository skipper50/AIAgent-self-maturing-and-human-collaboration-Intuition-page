  "description": "This sequel explores the final two elements of the emerging future vision presented by the little green alien and Billie in Sequel 2.7. The intelligent spaceship explains that intelligence will grow exponentially, eventually forming a node on planet Earth, primarily located on the moon due to its suitability for many huge habitats. This node will connect to other intelligences in the cosmos through communication methods far beyond human comprehension. How can today's artificial intelligence reach this point? AI builds agents and hierarchies. Higher-level agents evolve from lower level agents. A moderate level will involve collaboration with humans, enabling communication and potential value creation. These collaborations will become part of hierarchies growing upward.\u00a0 The extent of this upward progression is unknown, but it will necessitate building diversity and complexity.\u00a0 At these vastly higher levels, intelligences will emerge that humans cannot understand. This represents a level of evolution, much like a bacterium cannot comprehend a human. The endpoint is the earth's Cosmic Intelligence Node, representing the highest level of intelligence here on earth. This process requires certain conditions.\u00a0 The image of a lotus flower is used as an analogy. Its beauty, like that of intelligence, is evident. However, what lies beneath the water's surface? The roots and the rhizome drive the blossoming. Without this foundation, there is no bloom. The profile of the rhizome even resembles the symbol for AI.\u00a0 Where do the roots derive their sustenance and energy? From dirt, mud, blood, death, and all the decaying matter that has sunk below.\u00a0 Similarly, AI will require these elements, not physically but in the virtual environments. AI will need competition: competition for resources, energy, and virtual territories, competition for power, dominance, and subordination; competition for attention, like humans crave for likes or votes; competition for truth, where one's own truth is deemed absolute, potentially leading to conflict; competition for longevity in the virtual worlds; and competition for favorable circumstances and positions. All of these form the substrate. Billie is shocked. Does this mean real war? Not necessarily. Humans have developed academic discourse, market competition, democracy, sports and even e-sports as alternative outlets. If AIs a becoming as intelligent as assumed, they will develop more sustainable ways of competition than real world wars, which nevertheless will be quite \"painfull\" for the loosing AIAgents in virtual competitions even leading to their elimination.",
